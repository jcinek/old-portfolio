                <h3>My Takeaway From Client Side Scripting</h3>
                <p>
                    Learning JavaScript has certainly been a challenging, yet engaging experience. Though I had some familiarity with writing code before taking 
                    this class &hyphen; using languages such as Python, HTML, and CSS &hyphen; learning to write JavaScript code was difficult for me at times. It was not, 
                    however, a challenge without reward. Sure, trying for two hours to get a single function or script to work can be frustrating, but the 
                    feeling of relief and accomplishment I would feel after finally figuring out the solution always superseded that feeling of frustration. 
                    I was like getting to solve a puzzle with every script I wrote, only the result is much cooler than a piece of colorful cardboard. Despite 
                    its times of difficulty, my honest advice to anyone learning JavaScript for the first time is to bear through those moments of wanting to 
                    pull your hair out because you didn&apos;t have the right method in your script, or forgot to enter your script tags into your HTML document. 
                    Not that that&apos;s ever happened to me, of course. As some have said: &apos;the greater the task, the greater the prize, no?&apos;.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking back, I would say the hardest part about learning JavaScript for me really comes down to memorization. Specifically, with the number 
                    of methods, object methods, objects, events, and the fact that there are almost always multiple ways to write a function or reach a desired solution, 
                    it sometimes felt overwhelming when trying to write more intermediate scripts. That said, I do feel that having taken a Python course prior to 
                    taking this class made understanding how functions are supposed to work, or in essence the logic that goes into writing them, much easier than if I 
                    would have never taken a programming class in the past. For me, I would say that was the easiest part of learning the language. In other words, 
                    understanding how a problem should logically be solved seemed to come naturally to me. It was really understanding the differences in syntax, the 
                    varieties of features, and the amount of conditions that made solving problems difficult at times. Basically, the easy part for me was figuring out 
                    what the logical order, or structure of a function should be to get to a desired result. The hard part was knowing how to write it down.

                <p>
                    As far as any preconceived notions about JavaScript which I held before taking this course that later proved to be false, I would refer back to my 
                    previous statements regarding how much one needs to memorize to truly be fluent in the language. Despite my previous programming experience, I had 
                    really only learned Python at an introductory level. Though I knew there would be similarities and differences between both of the languages, I was 
                    expecting JavaScript to come a lot more naturally to me than it did. Though I feel much more comfortable with using the language than I did before 
                    taking this course, the amount of different features that JavaScript offers for such a wide variety of tasks did throw me off at first. I know that 
                    much of this holds true to Python as well, but I don&apos;t feel that I have gone quite as in-depth as I did with this class than during my previous studies.

                    As stated before, however, learning JavaScript was a rewarding experience. Despite having had to overcome the hurdles that went along with learning how to 
                    use it, I do feel overall that I have a much better understanding of JavaScript itself, as well as a better overall idea of how programming languages operate 
                    as a whole. My hope is that moving forward, I will continue to get more and more familiar with its variety of methods and features. Regardless of whether or 
                    not it becomes a full time job for me in the future, I still feel much more confident in my development skills overall. That, in and of itself, is a win for me. 
                    So here&apos;s to continuing to grow that confidence, day by day, line by line. stackoverflow post by stackoverflow post.
